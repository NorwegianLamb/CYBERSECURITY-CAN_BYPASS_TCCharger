# CyberSecurity Project: BYPASS CAN Protocol in a TC Charger
You can use this code to bypass the CAN protocol of a TC charger, it will erogate as much VOLTAGE/AMPERAGE as required (within, of course, the limit of the charger)
This can be useful in case you need to use it as a normal charger, without having the need of setting up the CAN communication between the components.
- [] add table content

## Code explaination
- [] add argv to use terminal to specify VOLTAGE/AMP, leave 100V/60A as default
- [] manage HEATING-MODE time and CHARGING-MODE time
- [] add a SMART mode (?)

## Examples
- [] Add video/photoes links?
